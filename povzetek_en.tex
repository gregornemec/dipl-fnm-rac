\section*{Abstract}
\label{sec:abstract}

In recent years we have seen an emergence of numerous web portals that offer
programming lessons. In this diploma thesis we wanted to research what these web
portals are and how they could be incorporated into primary and secondary school
lessons. We have analyzed these web portals that have been created in certain
academic circles and then applied certain criteria for classification and
evaluation of these web portals. There are many newly created web portals and we
choose to limit our choice with criteria such as free access to materials and
advanced combination of content. Our analysis of these web portals has shown
that each of them offers numerous possibilities of use, but also that there are
some negative aspects to them. We have shown with two concrete examples how such
web portals could be used in the classroom.

\textbf{Key words:} Programming lessons, web portals, programming language.
